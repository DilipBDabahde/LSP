1. Write a program which is used to create simple thread by using pthread library.
	
	to complete this application one new thread create in main thread, here require new library named as pthread.h 
	in this library we refer some function prototypes names as
	
	int pthread_create(&t1, attr, (void*)fun_name, (void*)args)
	in this function we pass some argumets to create thread 
	
	int pthread_join(t1, &status)
	this call is used to wait till thread exits and return its status

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Write a program which creates two thread , first thread print numbers 
   from 1 to 500 & other thread print the numbers from 500 to 1.
   
   in this applicattion two thread create by calling pthread_create() function two times
   and t1 prints 1 to N  in ascending order number 
   t2 prints N to 1 in descending order number 
   both displaying values done in two diff functions they gets call while create thread
   in main thread till exit from called function pthread_join() method hold status of child thread

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Write a program which creates single thread and we have to pass
   parameter to that thread from main thread.
   
   in main thread we create one array which contains string and we pass this string from main thread to child thread
   while creating child thread last argument is created array which has string. this string we display into start_routine
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Write a program which is used to get thread id inside its thread function.
	
   to get thread of main we call pthread-self() which return thread id of main thread
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Write a program which creates single thread and it accept one value from
   user and it return some value to the caller thread.
   
   in main thread we create child thread then control goes to child thread where we accept integral value and return it 
   to main thread using pthread_exit(accepted value);
   this value display from main thread
