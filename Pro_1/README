In this two application we learn how to use open system call and after open system call what opeartion we can perform on this opened system call that we learn.



prototype :
int open(filename,MODE)

file name with absolute path is always good.
Mode is which mode we want to open file to perform operation.

return value of open system call is int type

after opening file we can perform any operation depends on mode and access permission of file


int write(fd, str, len);

fd is first parameter and used to give access of opend file
str : which contains string 
len : how many bytes to write

int read(fd, buff, len);

fd : which pointed to opened file
buff: in which we read data from the file
len : bytes we are going to read


Makefile

to perform all operation with singly command we need to create makefile for our files instread of seperately compiling and running them
