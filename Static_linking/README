we create seperate file 

headers.h 
which contains all prototypes of function


server.c
which contains all function definition


client.c
which contains main function definition and from main 
we call to server.c's definition


but now we create archive of server.c using cmd

$cc -g -c server.c			

this above cmd create .o file which we use to make archive file

$ar r libdemo.a server.o

now our libdemo.a file we use to call definition 

now we can remove server.o

$rm server.o

once libdemo.a is created then 

compile main fucntion with libdemo.a

$gcc 	client.c libdemo.a -o myexe -w
$./myexe 									<---- it display result
